# Midterm Proposal

For my midterm, I would like to focus on livecoding visuals. I would like to teach myself how to use visuals in MAX, and do improv visuals using different modules.

I am inspired by this video:

I haven't taken a MAX class yet, and I think one of the best ways to learn something is by yourself just by messing around with it. Plus, this is something I'm very interested in. 

My goal is to be able to improvise and construct visuals in MAX, then deconstruct. Similar to live coding audio.
