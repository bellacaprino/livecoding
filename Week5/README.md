# Code I contributed

I was in charge of much of the melodic stuff, like arps and melodic notes. I completly forgot to use the toys sound which I was dissapointed in myself for. I had two arps panned sine and cosine, but tbh I couldn't hear myself most of the time. I tried to fade in and out, which is why. Our mix was very loud. I also did bird noises. Opened and closed with them. Honestly the whole performance went by so quickly that I didn't get to do everything I wanted!

# How my group worked together

My group communicated well but I feel like we were all competing to be heard. We set roles at the beginning which kind of felt counter intuitive to the message of live coding. I felt like it was necessary though. Everyone was very nice and contributed, I felt like I had to hold back a little bit during the show because everyone was doing so much, which was unfortunate. But I'm happy with what happened and of my group for making weird noise:-)
