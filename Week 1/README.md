# The New

1. I learned about the BoSSA, which allows for omnidirectional sound and can be played like a violin (I want one!!!) Also the fact that the act of building and dissasembling the instrument is part of the art itself. 

2. Plork players sit on mediitation pillows!! I really like this - it feels like mindfulness. Wired and wireless connections. I also like that the barrier is quite low to begin playing, I really like that perspective of FOSS.

I realized this practice is very mindful and deliberate which I love. I am so excited to get better at this and connect with other laptopists ot make beautiful noise.

# The Old

1. It makes sense that each laptopist would have to consider the sound each player makes. For it to not be too loud or homogenous. 

2. The differences between instrumnetal orchestras and laptopist orchestras is something I've been thinking about recently. ALl the points stated make sense to me. Such as how the instruments take decades to master and the difference in number of players 

# The Manifesto
*Give us access to the performer’s mind, to the whole human instrument.*

I like this point, the idea that the laptop is an extension of the human persons creativity is appealing to me. I think I have some cognitive bias about computors that make this seem immediatly silly to me - but when I address it with my logical brain it makes sense. 


*Obscurantism is dangerous. Show us your screens…*

100% Agree with this. Everything in the open! Teach the masses how to code!

*Embrace error, risk is the way to go. Live coding embraces worst practices.*

I think this is applicable in practice settibgs but during gigs maybe go tried and true. I think this is similar to many forms of performace. Mess up in practice so you nail it for the real thing.

*Code is an interface to oneself, and the self is an interface to culture. To code is to decode.*

This seems like a lot of words that basically mean coding can reveal things about society. I guess I haven't gotten far enough in my coding journy to experience this.

*Programming and programmer are both part of the runtime environment.*

100%, the code is an extention of the person

*We weave expression through algorithms that thrive in uncertainty.*

I like this way of thinking - that we express ourselves in algorithms

*To hack is to play seriously. Rules are good because they can be changed.*

Does this imply we should "hack" live coding performaces...? ;)
